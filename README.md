# Tower Architect

This is the bug tracker and release repository for Tower Architect by Chiori-chan.

Q. Where is the source code?

A. I'm sorry to say that until further notice, I will be keeping the source code for this game private for reasons.
But don't worry, if your interested in contributing, contact me. I'm in need of an pixel art designer and maybe an extra programmer.
